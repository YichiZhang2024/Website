I am from Shandong, China and my native language is mandarin. I pursued my bachelor degree at Dickinson College with double major in Mathematics and Psychology. My interest in using statistical tools to understand human behaviors led me to pursue a Phd degree in quantitative psychology.\nMy current research interests are measurement bias in survey/questionnaires and robust statistical models, such as hierarchical linear model(linear mixed effects model), latent variable model (structural equation modeling), etc. I am co-advised by Dr. Hok Chio(Mark) Lai (https://quantscience.rbind.io/) and Dr. Rand Wilcox. I am interested in exploring research questions related to fair and accurate psychological measurement using psychometric methods and statistical models. Check out the Research page for specific projects and Publication page for my publications. CV can be found here\n\n\n\n",
