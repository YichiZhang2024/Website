      "contents": "\n\n\nHi, I am a third year Ph.D. students in the Quantitative Methods and Computational Psychology program at the University of Southern California (USC). I am from Shandong, China and my native language is mandarin. I pursued my bachelor degree at Dickinson College with double major in Mathematics and Psychology. My interest in using statistical tools to understand human behaviors led me to pursue a Phd degree in quantitative psychology.\nMy current research interests are measurement invariance, multilevel modeling, and robust methods. My advisors are Dr. Hok Chio(Mark) Lai (https://quantscience.rbind.io/) and Dr. Rand Wilcox. I am interested in exploring research questions related to fair and accurate psychological measurement using psychometric methods and statistical models. Check out the Research page for specific projects and Publication page for my publications. CV can be found here\n\n\n\n",
