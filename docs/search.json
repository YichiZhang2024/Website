I am from Shandong, China and my native\nlanguage is mandarin. I pursued my bachelor degree at Dickinson College with double\nmajor in Mathematics and Psychology. My interest in using statistical\ntools to understand human behaviors led me to pursue a Phd degree in\nquantitative psychology.\nMy current research interests are measurement bias in\nsurvey/questionnaires and robust statistical models, such as\nhierarchical linear model(linear mixed effects model), latent variable\nmodel (structural equation modeling), etc. I am co-advised by Dr. Hok\nChio(Mark) Lai (https://quantscience.rbind.io/) and Dr. Rand Wilcox. I\nam interested in exploring research questions related to fair and\naccurate psychological measurement using psychometric methods and\nstatistical models. Check out the Research page for\nspecific projects and Publication page for my\npublications. CV can be found here\n\n\n\n",
