My work focuses on the validity, reliability, and fairness of psychological and behavioral measurement through applied statistical modeling and psychometric analysis.\nI earned my Ph.D. in Quantitative Methods and Computational Psychology from the University of Southern California (USC), where I was co-advised by Dr. Hok Chio(Mark) Lai and Dr. Rand Wilcox. My training emphasized robust statistical methods, measurement theory, and computational approaches to behavioral science.\nI first discovered my passion for computational social science as an undergraduate at Dickinson College, where I double majored in Mathematics and Psychology. Since then, I’ve become increasingly interested in using statistical modeling and machine learning to understand human behavior and drive informed decision-making in both research and applied contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m passionate about bridging the gap between rigorous research and real-world impact through academic collaborations, user experience research, or data science applications. Check out the Research page for specific projects and Publication page for my publications. CV can be found here.\n\n\n\n",

However, as the current generation has become more racially and ethnically diverse, people might react differently to scale items due to their diverse backgrounds and experiences. Thus, some scale items may contain systematic bias that leads to a higher score for some subgroups. While there is abundant research focusing on detecting such bias, most of them rely on the Null hypothesis testing (NHST) framework, with little attention to the degree of bias and the practical impact of bias.\nI proposed a Bayesian region of measurement equivalence (ROME) method for establishing measurement invariance, which allows researchers to quantify the degree of item bias on total scale scores and decide whether the group difference caused by biased indicators is negligible. This method allows researchers to interpret the noninvariance from a practical decision-making perspective. I applied this method on the National Assessment of Educational Progress data during my internship at the American Institutes for Research in 2022.\nEvaluating Standard Error Estimators for Multilevel Models on Small Samples With Heteroscedasticity and Unbalanced Cluster Sizes\nMultilevel modeling (MLM) is commonly used in psychological research to model clustered data. However, data in applied research usually come from small samples and have heteroscedastic variances and unbalanced cluster sizes, which violates one of the essential assumptions of MLM - homogeneity of variance. While the fixed-effect estimates produced by the maximum likelihood method remain unbiased, the standard errors for the fixed effects are mis-estimated, resulting in inaccurate inferences and inflated or deflated Type I error rates. Small-sample corrections, such as the Kenward-Roger (KR) adjustment and the adjusted cluster-robust standard errors (CR-SEs), have been proposed in literature.\nMy research compares KR with random slope (RS) models and the adjusted CR-SEs with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), random intercept (RI) and RS models to analyze small, heteroscedastic, clustered data using a Monte Carlo simulation. I illustrated the use of these two small sample corrections on empirical data and provide guidelines for applied researchers.\nEvaluating Subgroup Analysis Indices and Guidelines for Automated Scoring Algorithm\nAutomated Essay Scoring (AES) is an application of artificial intelligence that predicts the scores humans would assign to essays based on the content and features of those essays. Williamson, Xi, and Breyer (2012) offered guidelines for evaluating an AES system, and those guidelines recommend that stakeholders evaluate fairness by examining scores assigned to demographic subgroups with respect to distribution shifts and levels of agreement between AES and human scores.\nIn my research, I evaluated the performance of AES agreement indices used for subgroup analyses using a Monte Carlo simulation, in which I varied sample size, distribution shape, and the number of score points when data are generated to produce predetermined levels of agreement or mean score offset between human scores and AES. This project was presented at the 2024 National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME) Annual Meeting.\n\n\n\n",
