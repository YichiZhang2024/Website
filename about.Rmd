Hi, I'm a quantitative researcher and data scientist passionate about applying statistical tools to understand human behavior and drive data-informed decisions. I’m currently a Research Scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I focus on developing complex multilevel models and advancing psychological measurement to improve the reliability, validity, and fairness of large-scale behavioral assessments. Previously, I worked as a Quantitative Researcher at the American Institutes for Research (AIR), applying statistical and psychometrics methods to support the design, analysis, and evaluation of large-scale educational assessments. 

I earned my Ph.D. in [Quantitative Methods and Computational Psychology](https://dornsife.usc.edu/psyc/quantitative-methods/) from the University of Southern California (USC), where I was co-advised by [Dr. Hok Chio(Mark) Lai](https://quantscience.rbind.io/) and [Dr. Rand Wilcox](https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/rand-wilcox/). My training emphasized robust statistical methods, measurement theory, and computational approaches to behavioral science.

I first discovered my passion for computational social science as an undergraduate at [Dickinson College](https://www.dickinson.edu/), where I double majored in Mathematics and Psychology. Since then, I’ve become increasingly interested in using statistical modeling and machine learning to understand human behavior and drive informed decision-making in both research and applied contexts. 

<!-- My research interests include: -->

<!-- Measurement bias and fairness in surveys and assessments -->

<!-- Statistical methods for robust, reproducible research -->

<!-- Applied machine learning in social and behavioral sciences -->

<!-- Quantitative methods in UX research, education, and healthcare -->

I’m passionate about bridging the gap between rigorous research and real-world impact through academic collaborations, user experience research, or data science applications.
