## Current Projects

### Evaluating Standard Error Estimators for Multilevel Models on Small Samples With Heteroscedasticity and Unbalanced Cluster Sizes

- Compared the standard error estimators in multilevel models for small samples with heteroscedasticity and unbalanced cluster sizes using Monte Carlo simulation

- Proposal accepted by the 2022 AERA Annual Meeting Division D Graduate Student In-Progress Research Gala

### Bayesian Region of Measurement Equivalence (ROME) Approach for Establishing Measurement Invariance

- Identify noninvariant items using Bayesian alignment method and effect size indices

- Establish measurement invariance using the Bayesian Region of Measurement Equivalance (ROME) approach
