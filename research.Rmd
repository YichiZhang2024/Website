## Current Projects

### Bayesian Region of Measurement Equivalence (ROME) Approach for Establishing Measurement Invariance

- Proposed a Bayesian approach to establish measurement invariance using effect size indices

- Incorporated the alignment optimization to automate measurement invariance testing 

- Evaluate the performance using Monte Carlo simulation

- Extend to many group comparisons 


### Evaluating Standard Error Estimators for Multilevel Models on Small Samples With Heteroscedasticity and Unbalanced Cluster Sizes

- Compared two small-sample corrections for fixed-effects inferences in multilevel models with heteroscedastic and unbalanced data using Monte Carlo simulation

- Presented at AERA 2022 Annual Conference and IMPS 2022 Annual Meeting
